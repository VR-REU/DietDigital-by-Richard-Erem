Project Description

DietDigital is a Virtual Reality (VR) project aimed at studying the impact of VR on dietary choices. The project uses a VR simulation of a supermarket to measure food purchase behavior. The simulation allows users to select food items and provides detailed nutritional information for each item. The goal of the project is to understand how VR can be used to promote healthier food choices.

Key Findings

The VR simulation was found to be immersive and engaging, with high scores for presence and immersion.
The VR simulation successfully encouraged healthier food choices among participants, as evidenced by a significant decrease in the average caloric value of selected food items compared to their estimated real-life intake. This suggests the potential of VR simulations as effective tools for promoting healthier eating habits.

Project Setup
